        <p>This project was based around the game of Battleships, named ‘Sink the DictatorShips’. The biggest challenge was creating the ‘computer’ AI. Creating a function that plays the game logically after achieving it’s first randomised ‘hit’ of a ship, trying to find the rest of the ship nearby.</p>

        <p>The focus of this project was to bring together knitters and crocheters, entitled ‘Big Stitch Up. Users can create a profile to upload images of their designs, where other users can comment and request the pattern. Using the MeetUps API and Google Maps, users or non-users can find knitting and crochet MeetUp event in their area. The MeetUps API, although straight forward to use, was difficult to find specific enough events for knitting and crocheting. I think this was the most challenging aspect of the project.</p>

        <p>‘Buff’ is a planner for creating dates, finding a cinema equidistant from the users and their locations, then finding a nearby restaurant. My roles included implementing the APIs via the backend due to CORS issues using the CineList API, Google Maps and Google Places, wire framing and styling the application using SASS and Bootstrap Frameworks.</p>

      <div class="description" id="description4">
        <p>I wanted to create a platform where friends can borrow and lend items, which are used infrequently. I found and implemented a gem called ‘has-friendship’ to create the friendship relationship between users. One of the challenges for this project, was creating requests for 2 individual users and a single item but only belonging to one of the users, and being able to accept/decline/cancel requests. I plan to take this application further by adding messaging between users regarding items.</p>
